## Application Architecture


### Modules
- **core**: Contains the configuration of all the dependencies and their version used by the application, as well as a `Config.kt` file in which we find the definition of the API URL.
- **data**: Contains repositories, HTTP error handling, HTTP response and request templates, persistence with `Room`, and API definition with `Retrofit`.
- **features**: All the functionalities likely to be available in the application
    - **features/moviedetail**: The functionality to display the detail of a movie.
    - **features/movie**: The functionality to display the list of movies with the title, the average rating, and the cover.
- **domain**: Contains the different use cases and the definition of the repositories, the models.
- **utils**: Contains the graphic resources used in the different feature modules.

### Design pattern: MVVM (Model View View-Model)

- features/movie
    - `MovieDetailsScreen.kt` : The view, the graphical interface made with Jetpack Compose
    - `MovieDetailsViewModel.kt` : The bridge and the processing operations that take place between the database and the view
    - `State.kt` : The data model and the information presented to the view




# Third-party libraries

Libraries and their versions can be configured directly in the `build.gradle` of the Core module.

```kt
   ext.deps = [
                lottie                  : "com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose:${versions.lottie}",
                loggingInterceptor      : "com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:${versions.loggingInterceptor}",
                runtimeLiveData         : "androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:${versions.runtimeLiveData}",
                koin                    : "io.insert-koin:koin-core:${versions.koin}",
                koinAndroid                   : "io.insert-koin:koin-android:${versions.koin}"
   ]
```

# Negative aspects of the project/ways for improvement
- Better manage modularization
- Setting up a loading animation with Lottie
- Create better error handling, & displaying a snackbar
- Implementation of unit tests, E2E and integration tests
- Remove unnecessary items and code
- Try to verify possible leaks with LeakCanary
- Comment as much as possible on the code as well as the function parameters
